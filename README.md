# Intelligent-Video-Surveillance
This is a project on building an A.I cam for the detection of the suspicious activities around us

# Benefits of deep surveillance A.I cameras are: 
Can spot the suspicious and most wanted criminals wandering around especially in Airports/Public places 

Increasing the security to women and children in public areas and can detect a missing child

surveillance of militant activities at the borders 

security surveillance at stores

Securing home by identifying the visitors 

Making offices more secured by detecting unknown people moving around 

Can be used at check-in’s in Airport ports 

# TOOLS USED to build deep surveillance system are:
A Deep Learning Model Trained on my own by using 35,887 data set of images to predict the suspicious activities.

A cam to check on the people around. 

# TECHNICAL Knowhow and knowledge required to build algorithms using…,
Python

CNN Algorithm

Tensorflow

Keras

Open CV
